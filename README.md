## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications.

There are a variety of topics that make up the necessary skills for managing a Kubernetes cluster:

* How the cluster operates
* How to adjust, secure, and tune the cluster
* How to understand your cluster and respond when things go wrong
* How to extend your cluster with new and custom functionality
